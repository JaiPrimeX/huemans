You can not only search for the services you require, you can also see reviews, photos, and FAQs surrounding the added business. This will help provide a spotlight, and build a sense of community to support local businesses. Business owners can list deals at their own discretion, to encourage customers to support their business, continue their patronage, and refer more people to do the same. ",

      title: "Problem and Motivation",
      info: "In the United States, the average Black and Hispanic or Latino households earn about half as much as the average White household and own only about 15 to 20 percent as much net wealth. To combat the racial wealth gap, support is needed for minority businesses. There is very limited to no software or tools that exclusively supports searching up and reviewing minority-owned businesses. Due to this, excess time is spent searching and vetting for services by people of color and Huemans is to help aid in combatting this issue.",
